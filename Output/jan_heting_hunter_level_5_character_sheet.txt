################################################################################
Name: Alert
Origin: Origin Feat
Description: Tool Proficiency. You gain proficiency with three different Artisan's Tools of your choice from the Fast Crafting table.
Discount. Whenever you buy a nonmagical item, you receive a 20 percent discount on it.
Fast Crafting:
When you finish a Long Rest, you can craft one piece of gear from the Fast Crafting table,
provided you have the Artisan's Tools associated with that item and have proficiency with those tools. 
The item lasts until you finish another Long Rest, at which point the item falls apart.

Name: Darkvision
Origin: Gnome Trait
Description: You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

Name: Rock Gnome Prestidigitation
Origin: Gnomish Lineage Rock Gnome Trait
Description: Prestidigitation to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5,1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a Utilize action.

Name: Favored Enemy
Origin: Ranger Level 1
Description: You always have the Hunter's Mark spell prepared.
You can cast it 3 times without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.

Name: Replacing Weapon Masteries
Origin: Ranger Level 1
Description: Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose.

Name: Spell Casting
Origin: Ranger Level 1
Description: Spellcasting:
 * Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.
 * You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
 * Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

Name: Deft Explorer
Origin: Ranger Level 2
Description: Languages.: You know two languages of your choice from the language tables in chapter 2.

Name: Primal Companion
Origin: Beast Master Ranger Level 3
Description: You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. Choose its stat block: Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea or Beast of the Sky. You also determine the kind of animal it is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever beast you choose, it bears primal markings indicating its supernatural origin.
 * The Beast in Combat: In Combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Beast's Strike action. If you have the Incapacitated condition, the beast acts on its own and isn't limited to the dodge action.
 * Restoring or Replacing the Beast: If the beast has died within the last hour, you can take a Magic action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.
   Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can summon a different primal beast, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, the old one vanishes when the new one appears.

Name: Extra Attack
Origin: Ranger Level 5
Description: You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

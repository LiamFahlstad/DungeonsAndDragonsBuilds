# Discovered issues

Bugs, rules mismatches and gaps that agents (and people) found but did not fix in the task at
hand. Every agent may add to this file and mark entries fixed, **only through the script**:

```bash
python .claude/skills/discovered-issues/issues.py list --status open      # what's known
python .claude/skills/discovered-issues/issues.py add --title "..." --area <agent or area> \
    --where "<path:line>" --by <your name> --details "<what's wrong, a failing scenario, a fix>"
python .claude/skills/discovered-issues/issues.py update DI-007 --status fixed --commit <hash> --by <your name>
```

The script locks the file, so several agents can write at the same time. Don't edit entries
with Edit/Write. The `discovered-issues` skill has the rules for when to add, fix or close one.

### DI-001 · Temporary Hit Points stack instead of keeping one amount
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_apply_temp_hp`, `Combat/CombatUIQt/logging_mixin.py:338`

_apply_temp_hp adds new temp HP to the old (5 + 8 = 13); replay does the same. 2024 rule (Playing the Game > Temporary Hit Points, not in the local glossary): temp HP don't stack; the creature keeps either the old or the new amount. Fix: max(old, amount) or a keep/replace prompt, in both places.

### DI-002 · No instant death from massive damage
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_do_apply_damage`

A 20/20 creature with 10 temp HP takes 70: it ends at 0 HP and 'dying'. 2024 rule (Playing the Game > Instant Death): if damage reduces you to 0 HP and the remainder equals or exceeds your HP maximum, you die. Fix: compute the overflow before clamping HP to 0; if overflow >= max_hp, set death_saves_fail = 3.

### DI-003 · Damage at 0 HP adds no failed death save and doesn't end Stable
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_do_apply_damage`

A dying creature at 0 HP takes 3 damage: failures stay 0. A stable creature that is hit stays stable. 2024 rule (Playing the Game > Damage at 0 Hit Points): 1 failed save, 2 on a Critical Hit, death if the damage >= HP maximum. The UI has no crit flag, so at least add 1 failure (and clear Stable) when pre_hp <= 0 and dmg > 0.

### DI-004 · Unconscious isn't applied at 0 HP
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_do_apply_damage`

Knockout drops Concentration but never adds the Unconscious condition, so its effects (attackers have Advantage, hits within 5 ft are crits, auto-fail Str/Dex saves) aren't shown. Fix: add Unconscious at knockout for creatures that make death saves; remove it when HP is regained.

### DI-005 · No buttons for a natural 20 or natural 1 on a death save
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/cards_mixin.py`

A 20 should restore 1 HP; a 1 counts as two failures. Today the GM clicks Fail twice or heals 1 by hand.

### DI-006 · Healing brings a dead creature back to life
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_apply_heal`, `Combat/CombatUIQt/rest.py:172`

Any heal on a creature with 3 failed death saves gives it HP, resets the saves and logs 'is resurrected'; healing a dying/stable creature is also logged as 'resurrected'. Dead.md: 'A dead creature has no Hit Points and can't regain them unless it is first revived by magic such as the Raise Dead or Revivify spell.' User deferred this on 2026-10-28 (may be a deliberate GM shortcut); confirm with them before fixing.

### DI-007 · Bloodied is removed when a creature drops to 0 HP
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_apply_bloodied_condition`

should_be_bloodied = hp > 0 and hp <= max_hp / 2. Bloodied.md: 'A creature is Bloodied while it has half its Hit Points or fewer remaining' - 0 counts. Low impact (badge only). User deferred this on 2026-10-28.

### DI-008 · Negative damage or heal input isn't rejected
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_do_apply_damage`, `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_apply_heal`

Typing -5 as damage adds 5 temp HP (temp_reduction = min(temp_hp, -5)); a negative heal deals damage. Reject values below 0 in both handlers.

### DI-010 · UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS with -n auto can lose golden updates
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** test-bughunter
- **Where:** `tests/_snapshot_helpers.py`, `pytest.ini:7`

On 2026-10-28, 'UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 ./run_tests.sh -q -k "<5 builds>"' rewrote only 4 of the 5 builds' sheet_hashes.json entries; rerunning for the missing build alone fixed it. Likely several xdist workers read-modify-write the same golden file at once. Fix: lock the golden file during updates, or have the update path run with -p no:xdist / -n 0.

**History**
- 2026-10-28 main-session: found
- 2026-10-28 claude-main: Also seen in tests/snapshots/combat_ui_cards.json (via tests/_combat_ui.py check_golden): the races left truncated, invalid JSON, not just lost entries

### DI-012 · Epic boons can't grant spells, so boon spells are text only
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** character-engine-dev
- **Where:** `CharacterContent/Classes/BaseClasses/BardBase.py:296`, `CharacterContent/Features/CharacterFeats/EpicBoon.py:955`, `CharacterContent/Features/CharacterFeats/EpicBoon.py:1275`, `CharacterContent/Features/CharacterFeats/EpicBoon.py:385`

Every class base adds the level-19 boon with data.add_feature(self.epic_boon) (ArtificerBase.py:264, BarbarianBase.py:204, BardBase.py:296, ... RogueBase.py:188), which has no spell path. So Boon of Revelry's Otto's Irresistible Dance, Boon of Siberys's chosen spell and Boon of Magic School Mastery's spells appear only in the description and are never added to the character's spell list or spell cards. Fix: give EpicBoon an optional grant_to(data) hook like GeneralFeat.grant_to (GeneralFeats.py:112) and have the class bases call it, then move the three boons' spells onto it.

### DI-013 · Boon effects that apply only while Bloodied are text only
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** character-engine-dev
- **Where:** `CharacterContent/Features/CharacterFeats/EpicBoon.py:768`, `CharacterContent/Features/CharacterFeats/EpicBoon.py:1121`, `CharacterContent/Features/CharacterFeats/EpicBoon.py:598`

The engine has no way to express a resistance or immunity that holds only under a condition. So Boon of Desperate Resilience's resistances and Boon of the Furious Storm's immunity (both only while Bloodied), and Boon of the Night Spirit's resistance (only in dim light or darkness), are left out of the sheet's resistance/immunity lists and appear only in the feature text. Fix: a conditional-defense entry (e.g. 'Resistance to X while Bloodied') that the sheet shows with its condition, and that the combat simulator could apply when Bloodied.

### DI-014 · tag_report.py misses usage_tags set as a class attribute
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** main-session
- **Where:** `.claude/skills/usage-tags/tag_report.py:36`

tag_report.py finds tags only as a literal usage_tags=[...] keyword in a call inside the class. A class that sets _USAGE_TAGS = [...] and passes it via a base class's __init__ shows as untagged, although the card renders the tags. Found while adding the Faerun Epic Boons (the agent worked around it by passing the literal in each subclass's super().__init__). Fix: also read a class-level _USAGE_TAGS list, or fall back to instantiating the feature and reading .usage_tags.

## Fixed

### DI-009 · Summons with hp=0 stat blocks show as dead in the combat simulator
- **Status:** fixed · 2026-10-28 · uncommitted
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/Monsters/CR_0/monsters.py:DraconicSpirit`

Spell-summoned creatures (e.g. Draconic Spirit) have hp=0 in their generated stat block because the spell sets their HP. Since 03bcecb0 a monster at 0 HP without death_saves is dead, so they appear with the skull icon until the GM sets HP. Possible fix: prompt for HP when adding a 0-HP combatant, or treat max_hp == 0 as 'HP not set'. Don't hand-edit the generated monsters.py.

- 2026-10-28 claude-main: marked in-progress; Main session working on it
- 2026-10-28 claude-main: marked fixed; Initiative screen now asks for HP for any combatant with max HP 0 (Start Combat stays disabled until it's a positive number) and _char_death_state treats max HP 0 as 'HP not set', not dead. Uncommitted in the working tree.

### DI-011 · Spell improved descriptions orphaned by the 2024 spell additions
- **Status:** fixed · 2026-10-28 · ea8a58f5
- **Area:** spell-improved-descriptions
- **Where:** `CharacterContent/Spells/spells_dnd5e_improved.json`, `CharacterContent/Spells/spells_dnd2024_improved.json`

a19d9d7e added 2024 versions of Catnap, Enervation, Negative Energy Flood and Power Word Pain, so their 2014 improved descriptions no longer loaded and Astral Flood's flavor stopped matching its rescraped text. This broke 20 tests (spell descriptions, 5 build snapshots, 10 order-invariance).

**History**

## Won't fix

### DI-015 · UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 under xdist corrupts shared golden JSON files
- **Status:** wontfix
- **Area:** tests
- **Where:** `tests/_combat_ui.py:check_golden`

run_tests.sh runs pytest with xdist workers; with UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 each worker does load/modify/save on the same golden file (e.g. tests/snapshots/combat_ui_cards.json), so the writes race and leave truncated/garbled JSON (seen while fixing DI-009). Workaround: add -n0. Possible fix: lock the file in save(), or have run_tests.sh force -n0 when UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS is set.

# Discovered issues

Bugs, rules mismatches and gaps that agents (and people) found but did not fix in the task at
hand. Every agent may add to this file and mark entries fixed, **only through the script**:

```bash
python .claude/skills/discovered-issues/issues.py list --status open      # what's known
python .claude/skills/discovered-issues/issues.py add --title "..." --area <agent or area> \
    --where "<path:line>" --by <your name> --details "<what's wrong, a failing scenario, a fix>"
python .claude/skills/discovered-issues/issues.py update DI-007 --status fixed --commit <hash> --by <your name>
```

The script locks the file, so several agents can write at the same time. Don't edit entries
with Edit/Write. The `discovered-issues` skill has the rules for when to add, fix or close one.

## Open

### DI-001 · Temporary Hit Points stack instead of keeping one amount
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_apply_temp_hp`, `Combat/CombatUIQt/logging_mixin.py:338`

_apply_temp_hp adds new temp HP to the old (5 + 8 = 13); replay does the same. 2024 rule (Playing the Game > Temporary Hit Points, not in the local glossary): temp HP don't stack; the creature keeps either the old or the new amount. Fix: max(old, amount) or a keep/replace prompt, in both places.

### DI-002 · No instant death from massive damage
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_do_apply_damage`

A 20/20 creature with 10 temp HP takes 70: it ends at 0 HP and 'dying'. 2024 rule (Playing the Game > Instant Death): if damage reduces you to 0 HP and the remainder equals or exceeds your HP maximum, you die. Fix: compute the overflow before clamping HP to 0; if overflow >= max_hp, set death_saves_fail = 3.

### DI-003 · Damage at 0 HP adds no failed death save and doesn't end Stable
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_do_apply_damage`

A dying creature at 0 HP takes 3 damage: failures stay 0. A stable creature that is hit stays stable. 2024 rule (Playing the Game > Damage at 0 Hit Points): 1 failed save, 2 on a Critical Hit, death if the damage >= HP maximum. The UI has no crit flag, so at least add 1 failure (and clear Stable) when pre_hp <= 0 and dmg > 0.

### DI-004 · Unconscious isn't applied at 0 HP
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_do_apply_damage`

Knockout drops Concentration but never adds the Unconscious condition, so its effects (attackers have Advantage, hits within 5 ft are crits, auto-fail Str/Dex saves) aren't shown. Fix: add Unconscious at knockout for creatures that make death saves; remove it when HP is regained.

### DI-005 · No buttons for a natural 20 or natural 1 on a death save
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/cards_mixin.py`

A 20 should restore 1 HP; a 1 counts as two failures. Today the GM clicks Fail twice or heals 1 by hand.

### DI-006 · Healing brings a dead creature back to life
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_apply_heal`, `Combat/CombatUIQt/rest.py:172`

Any heal on a creature with 3 failed death saves gives it HP, resets the saves and logs 'is resurrected'; healing a dying/stable creature is also logged as 'resurrected'. Dead.md: 'A dead creature has no Hit Points and can't regain them unless it is first revived by magic such as the Raise Dead or Revivify spell.' User deferred this on 2026-10-28 (may be a deliberate GM shortcut); confirm with them before fixing.

### DI-007 · Bloodied is removed when a creature drops to 0 HP
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_apply_bloodied_condition`

should_be_bloodied = hp > 0 and hp <= max_hp / 2. Bloodied.md: 'A creature is Bloodied while it has half its Hit Points or fewer remaining' - 0 counts. Low impact (badge only). User deferred this on 2026-10-28.

### DI-008 · Negative damage or heal input isn't rejected
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_do_apply_damage`, `Combat/CombatUIQt/damage_mixin.py:_apply_heal`

Typing -5 as damage adds 5 temp HP (temp_reduction = min(temp_hp, -5)); a negative heal deals damage. Reject values below 0 in both handlers.

### DI-009 · Summons with hp=0 stat blocks show as dead in the combat simulator
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** combat-simulator
- **Where:** `Combat/Monsters/CR_0/monsters.py:DraconicSpirit`

Spell-summoned creatures (e.g. Draconic Spirit) have hp=0 in their generated stat block because the spell sets their HP. Since 03bcecb0 a monster at 0 HP without death_saves is dead, so they appear with the skull icon until the GM sets HP. Possible fix: prompt for HP when adding a 0-HP combatant, or treat max_hp == 0 as 'HP not set'. Don't hand-edit the generated monsters.py.

### DI-010 · UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS with -n auto can lose golden updates
- **Status:** open
- **Area:** test-bughunter
- **Where:** `tests/_snapshot_helpers.py`, `pytest.ini:7`

On 2026-10-28, 'UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 ./run_tests.sh -q -k "<5 builds>"' rewrote only 4 of the 5 builds' sheet_hashes.json entries; rerunning for the missing build alone fixed it. Likely several xdist workers read-modify-write the same golden file at once. Fix: lock the golden file during updates, or have the update path run with -p no:xdist / -n 0.

## Fixed

### DI-011 · Spell improved descriptions orphaned by the 2024 spell additions
- **Status:** fixed · 2026-10-28 · ea8a58f5
- **Area:** spell-improved-descriptions
- **Where:** `CharacterContent/Spells/spells_dnd5e_improved.json`, `CharacterContent/Spells/spells_dnd2024_improved.json`

a19d9d7e added 2024 versions of Catnap, Enervation, Negative Energy Flood and Power Word Pain, so their 2014 improved descriptions no longer loaded and Astral Flood's flavor stopped matching its rescraped text. This broke 20 tests (spell descriptions, 5 build snapshots, 10 order-invariance).
